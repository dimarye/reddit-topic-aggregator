Aivazovski Spreadsheet

A browser-based spreadsheet application built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the clarity and creativity of Aivazovsky’s seascapes, this project showcases a clean, intuitive, and functional tool for managing data — all without frameworks or external libraries.

Features





Editable Grid: 10 columns (A-J) × 99 rows with responsive height adjustment for content.



Live Formula Support: Calculate expressions like =SUM(1,2), =AVERAGE(A1:A3), or =RANGE(1,5) in real-time.



Rich Text Formatting: Apply bold, italic, underline, text alignment, and background color to cells.



Undo & Selection: Undo stack for actions, row/column selection, and copy-paste support (including multiline content).



Keyboard Navigation: Navigate cells using arrow keys for a seamless UX.



Custom UI: Designed with CSS Grid and Flexbox for an intuitive and modern layout.

About Me

I’m a junior developer with 8 months of programming experience, focusing on frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend with Django. This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and building functional web applications from scratch.

I’m actively looking for frontend or full-stack opportunities (internships or junior roles). If you’re hiring or have suggestions for improvement, I’d love to connect!
